# M01W04 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Blocking Code
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] `setTimeout`
* [x] Async Return Values
* [x] `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
* Synchronous
  * sequential
  * each line of code is executed after the previous line
  * blocking (other code cannot execute until the sync code is done)

```js
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);

const a = 5;
console.log(a);
```

* Asynchronous
  * doesn't necessarily run in the order written
  * step out of the way


// async code rule #1: async code cannot run until ALL sync code is done
// async code rule #2: async functions don't have return values
